# Riders Beacon

### How did the concept emerge?
This idea came when my friend and I were going for the East Nepal ride. Friend was a pillion and to talk with him I needed to shout a lot. And if there was a way to talk easily with current resources. And an App came to mind. Walkie Talkie communicates via Bluetooth for pillion and WiFi for multi riders.

### Target audience and why?
Its main purpose is for the bike riders who have difficulties to communicate with the riders. Or riders who want to buy an intercom and are thinking of other cheap alternatives. Or more advanced than normal/cheap intercom and more reliable. Also can have more features than the intercom.

##### What will be the features?

##### Offline features:
- Pillion rider communication module
- Multiple rider communication module using WiFi direct
- Multiple rider communication module using Router
- Multiple rider communication with mesh technology

##### Online/offline features:
- Rider chat (for trip that creates a group till the ride ends)
- Group Notification (for eg. Tomorrow ride start and planning or any other notifications)
